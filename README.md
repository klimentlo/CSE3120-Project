### What is the purpose of this program? 
-----

This program allows you to play the dice game "Ship Captain Crew", but digitally on the computer! The purpose of the game is to obtain as much gold as possible, having to find a certain amount of gold in order to win. In this program, you must acquire a total of 40 gold or more before your opponent to win. More information about how the game works is accessable at https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/ship-captain-and-crew/.

### Extra Features:
-----

- You can choose the amount of dice you get per round. The normal amount is 5, but you can change it to as big of a nubmer as you want, as long it has at least 4 total die.

- A toggleable modifier allows a player to gamble for double or nothing, requiring them to find another set of Ship, Captain, and Crew. If they are able to find this set within their set amount of rolls of that round, their treaure is doubled during that round!

### Reflection

-----

I found that its easy to overcomplicate and overengineer a piece of code. Sometimes its easier to take a step back and read through your code, maybe taking a day long break and coming back to it. Although brute forcing to find a solution in creating code is possible, it may be healthier to take some time off and to think about it casually throughout the day instead of sitting at the computer staring at the screen as you slowly lose your mind. 

I also found it difficult to figure out which attributes should go where. I'm also not really sure where the menu() and intro() things should be, as they feel so out of place being inside of a class, but I found it more simplistic and easy to retrieve and access the information from said class if its in that class.

Overall, good experience. 8/10
BUT I HATE FLOWCHARTS. Theres so many factors to think about and having to construct it and place it accordingly, and then miraclously making it so all the pieces fit the puzzle.
